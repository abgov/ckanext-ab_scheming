A total of 1190 garter snakes were relocated to a den 9.5 km away that contained over 8500 snakes. Thirty percent of the relocated snakes returned to the new den in the following years. None of the relocated snakes returned to their old den site. Size class measurements show the new den to contain a normal distribution of sizes, while the size distribution of relocated snakes was slightly skewed to larger size classes. Growth rates of the resident snakes and the relocated snakes were similar. Overall the project has been very successful, and shows that snakes can be relocated successfully to anotehr occuped den. Education projects included talks, posters, field trips, media relases and another snake den management program in Fort Assiniboine. A Snakes of Alberta poster was produced and will also increase public knowledge about snakes and their environments.","num_resources":0,"num_tags":0,"other":null,"owner_org":"sustainableresourcedevelopment2001-2006--2006-2013","placeofpub":"Edmonton","private":false,"relationships_as_object":[],"relationships_as_subject":[],"replacedby_title":"","replacedby_uri":null,"replaces_title":"","replaces_uri":null,"resources":[],"revision_id":null,"sensitivity":"unrestricted","seriestitle":"Alberta wildlife status report ","seriestitle2":null,"seriestitle3":null,"spatialcoverage":"","state":null,"subject":"Common garter snake--Alberta","subject2":"Garter snakes--Alberta","subject3":"Wildlife management--Alberta","tags":[],"time_coverage_from":null,"time_coverage_to":null,"title":"Red-sided garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis) relocation and education project: final report","topic":["Environment"],"tracking_summary":{"recent":0,"total":0},"pubtype":"report","updatefrequency":"Once","url":null,"usageconsiderations":null,"version":null,"subject4":"Environmental education--Alberta","subject5":"","subject6":"","contributor6":null,"contributor5":null,"contributor4":null,"type":"publications"}

In 2001, a comprehensive review of the survey was undertaken, to ensure that the inputs monitored were relevant and consistent with Alberta�s current farming practices and that there was adequate coverage across the province. Effective July 2001, the number of farm inputs priced monthly was increased to 53 from 45, and the number of centers monitored across Alberta expanded to 25 from 18. The revised list of farm inputs included a number of new inputs, while some of the old inputs were dropped or modified. Further reviews were completed in June 2006, July 2007, and January 2012 to ensure continued relevance. As such, some farm inputs in the 2013-2014 Overview are not comparable on a �year-over-year� basis with the previous years.  Monthly average prices reported are intended to serve as a guide only.

This publication presents a summary of custom work and rental rates. These rates are only intended as a guide. They are not to be interpreted as the rates you must charge or pay. The goal is to report what is being charged, not what should be charged. The data presented in this report was obtained by contacting producers and custom operators and thus represent actual charges.

In low cover amounts, woody plants on tame pastures can provide complimentary livestock forage, provide shade, act as a snow trap, and provide benefits to wildlife. However, in higher amounts (increased density, diameter, height and cover), woody plants often become competitive and reduce the forage productivity of the tame pasture. In turn, this result can reduce grazing benefits and increase pasture management costs.

That�s why a 20-year strategic capital plan is so important � so we can look ahead, anticipate the pressures of growth, and take the necessary steps to put in place essential roads and highways, schools and hospitals, utilities and facilities to support a growing and changing Alberta.","num_resources":0,"num_tags":0,"other":null,"owner_org":"treasuryboard2004-2006--2008-2011--2013-2014","placeofpub":"Edmonton","private":false,"relationships_as_object":[],"relationships_as_subject":[],"replacedby_title":"","replacedby_uri":null,"replaces_title":"","replaces_uri":null,"resources":[],"revision_id":null,"sensitivity":"unrestricted","seriestitle":"","seriestitle2":null,"seriestitle3":null,"spatialcoverage":"","state":null,"subject":"Infrastructure (Economics)--Alberta","subject2":"Cities and towns--Alberta--Growth","subject3":"Energy industries--Alberta","tags":[],"time_coverage_from":null,"time_coverage_to":null,"title":"The 20-year strategic capital plan: to address Alberta's infrastructure needs","topic":["EconomyandFinance"],"tracking_summary":{"recent":0,"total":0},"pubtype":"report","updatefrequency":"Once","url":null,"usageconsiderations":null,"version":null,"subject4":"Schools--Alberta","subject5":"Highway planning--Alberta","subject6":"Highway planning--Alberta","contributor6":null,"contributor5":null,"contributor4":null,"type":"publications"}

The goal is to report what is being charged, not what should be charged.  Farmers may find custom rates useful as a guide for machinery management, budgeting and financial planning for credit needs. Also, custom rates can be used as a guide in negotiating settlements for work performed for neighbors or others. Lenders, educators, government institutions and others doing budgeting or planning analysis may also find custom rates helpful in their work.

The demand for workers in Alberta�s robust economy has led to a tight labour market and skill shortages in many occupational groups. Moreover, an aging population, leading to increased retirements, may further compound the shortage of skilled labour. To better understand and respond to this situation, Alberta Employment and Immigration (E&I) has developed both the Alberta Occupational Demand and Supply Outlook\nModels. Figure 1 provides an overview of the two models. These models project the\ndemand and supply for different occupations in Alberta between 2008 and 2018. By\ncalculating imbalances between demand and supply, future occupational shortages or\nsurpluses can be forecasted. Results from the two models help users make better\ndecisions about developing and funding programs and policies as well as personal\ndecisions about education, jobs and careers.","num_resources":0,"num_tags":0,"other":null,"owner_org":"employmentandimmigration2008-2011","placeofpub":"Edmonton","private":false,"relationships_as_object":[],"relationships_as_subject":[],"replacedby_title":"","replacedby_uri":null,"replaces_title":"","replaces_uri":null,"resources":[],"revision_id":null,"sensitivity":"unrestricted","seriestitle":"","seriestitle2":null,"seriestitle3":null,"spatialcoverage":"","state":null,"subject":"Labor market--Alberta--Periodicals","subject2":"Employment forecasting--Alberta--Periodicals","subject3":"Skilled labor--Alberta--Periodicals","tags":[],"time_coverage_from":"2008-01-01","time_coverage_to":"2018-01-01","title":"Alberta's occupational demand and supply outlook . . .","topic":["EmploymentandLabour"],"tracking_summary":{"recent":0,"total":0},"pubtype":"report","updatefrequency":"Annual","url":null,"usageconsiderations":null,"version":null,"subject4":"Occupational training--Alberta--Statistics","subject5":"","subject6":"","contributor6":null,"contributor5":null,"contributor4":null,"type":"publications"}

Since 1997 general and detailed status evaluation and recovery planning have been completed for many species. The 1997 strategy has been acted upon and many of the original objectives have been achieved or are ongoing. This revised document incorporates the strong process direction provided by that strategy and supplements it with increased emphasis on implementation of recovery actions, strategies to prevent species from becoming endangered, and conservation and stewardship programs for species at risk. Whereas the 1997 document was used to establish provincial processes, the current document describes the program that developed from that strategy and provides specific program guidance for the future. This document has been prepared to guide Alberta�s species at risk program for the five fiscal years from 2009/2010 to 2013/2014.","num_resources":0,"num_tags":0,"other":null,"owner_org":"sustainableresourcedevelopment2001-2006--2006-2013","placeofpub":"Edmonton","private":false,"relationships_as_object":[],"relationships_as_subject":[],"replacedby_title":"","replacedby_uri":null,"replaces_title":"","replaces_uri":null,"resources":[],"revision_id":null,"sensitivity":"unrestricted","seriestitle":"Publication no. 1/323","seriestitle2":null,"seriestitle3":null,"spatialcoverage":"","state":null,"subject":"Endangered species--Alberta","subject2":"Wildlife conservation--Alberta","subject3":"Endangered species--Research--Alberta","tags":[],"time_coverage_from":null,"time_coverage_to":null,"title":"Alberta's strategy for the management of species at risk (2009-2014)","topic":["Environment"],"tracking_summary":{"recent":0,"total":0},"pubtype":"report","updatefrequency":"Once","url":null,"usageconsiderations":null,"version":null,"subject4":"Wildlife management--Alberta","subject5":"","subject6":"","contributor6":null,"contributor5":null,"contributor4":null,"type":"publications"}

Examples of these situations include road paving, construction, forestry, agriculture, ranching, oil and gas industry, greenhouse or horticultural work, power line maintenance, and outdoor municipal work. This guidance may also be helpful to workplaces that have hot indoor environments such as kitchens, bakeries, pizza parlours, steam presses, laundries, or dry cleaning businesses. Cold indoor workplaces include those that have walk-in freezers, meat processing, or cold storage facilities. This publication will help the workers to: Understand how your body reacts in cold or hot environments; Recognize when it is �too� cold or �too� hot. Know the health risks associated with working in these temperatures; Be able to understand weather information or take simple measurements; Know what steps to take to control the hazards of exposure.","num_resources":0,"num_tags":0,"other":null,"owner_org":"employmentandimmigration2008-2011","placeofpub":"Edmonton","private":false,"relationships_as_object":[],"relationships_as_subject":[],"replacedby_title":"","replacedby_uri":null,"replaces_title":"","replaces_uri":null,"resources":[],"revision_id":null,"sensitivity":"unrestricted","seriestitle":"","seriestitle2":null,"seriestitle3":null,"spatialcoverage":"","state":null,"subject":"Body temperature","subject2":"Cold--Physiological effect","subject3":"Heat--Physiological effect","tags":[],"time_coverage_from":null,"time_coverage_to":null,"title":"Best practice - working safely in the heat and cold","topic":["EmploymentandLabour"],"tracking_summary":{"recent":0,"total":0},"pubtype":"guide","updatefrequency":"Once","url":null,"usageconsiderations":null,"version":null,"subject4":"","subject5":"","subject6":"","contributor6":null,"contributor5":null,"contributor4":null,"type":"publications"}

The species that make up the assemblage often show an affinity or association with each other (Kent and Coker 1992). To develop an initial tracking list of natural ecological community elements, publications describing vegetation in Alberta were reviewed and discussions were held with knowledgeable individuals. Community types that have been described as �unusual�, �uncommon�, �of limited extent� or �encountered infrequently� by vegetation experts were considered for inclusion on the Ecological Community Tracking List. Community types that have been described as �in decline� or �threatened� by vegetation experts were also considered for inclusion. Only natural communities were considered. The assistance many individuals in developing this tracking and watch list is gratefully acknowledged. Appended to the Tracking List is a �watch list�. This is an initial list of communities that appear to have a restricted distribution in Alberta and for which information will be collected to ascertain trends.","num_resources":0,"num_tags":0,"other":null,"owner_org":"tourismparksandrecreation1992--2008-2014","placeofpub":"Edmonton","private":false,"relationships_as_object":[],"relationships_as_subject":[],"replacedby_title":"","replacedby_uri":null,"replaces_title":"Alberta Natural Heritage Information Centre preliminary ecological community tracking list.","replaces_uri":null,"resources":[],"revision_id":null,"sensitivity":"unrestricted","seriestitle":"","seriestitle2":null,"seriestitle3":null,"spatialcoverage":"","state":null,"subject":"Botany--Alberta","subject2":"Rare plants--Alberta","subject3":"Plant communities--Alberta","tags":[],"time_coverage_from":null,"time_coverage_to":null,"title":"Alberta conservation information management system ecological community tracking list","topic":["Environment"],"tracking_summary":{"recent":0,"total":0},"pubtype":"report","updatefrequency":"Once","url":null,"usageconsiderations":null,"version":null,"subject4":"Plant conservation--Alberta","subject5":"","subject6":"","contributor6":null,"contributor5":null,"contributor4":null,"type":"publications"}

This was done to help readers clearly identify their top occupational choice (goal) from among a number of other satisfactory choices.  Work and You Book 1: Make Some Job Choices � This workbook uses stories and exercises to help adults with low literacy choose an occupational (job) goal. They will do a brief self-assessment, learn about different jobs and create a list of 1 to 3 jobs to investigate.  Work and You Book 2: Decide on a Job � In this workbook, adults with low literacy research and evaluate the short list of jobs they created in Work and You Book 1. In the end they will choose an occupational goal to pursue.

The crop report is used by industry and other stakeholders for various purposes, including drought monitoring and forecasting of production insurance payments. It is also used to validate some of the Alberta crop estimates generated by Statistics Canada.

These limits are based on data collected within the watershed, as well as more broad information on streamflow, water quality and requirements of the aquatic ecosystem. One of the key recommendations of the management framework was the development of an integrated monitoring program for the Muskeg River watershed to coordinate offlease monitoring activities that are currently conducted by individual companies and Alberta Environment.

The policies and procedures incorporated in this guide are modeled on the appraisal principle of reproduction cost, subject to divergences necessary to meet the requirements of Alberta�s assessment legislation and to provide a stable property tax base. The costs reported by the application of this guide are used by the assessor to determine the construction cost for property that is not described in Schedule A of the Linear Property Assessment Manual or Schedule A of the Machinery and Equipment Assessment Manual.\nMuch of the information used to determine construction cost is derived from the internal records of the company and provided by the company representative to the assessor. A company�s internal records may also include project costs that should not be included by the assessor when determining the property assessment. This guide identifies costs that are typically included � as well as costs that are excluded � in the determination of the property assessment.

They were established by the Government of Alberta in 1994 as part of a larger initiative to provide choice and to foster innovation in the education system. One of the original purposes of creating charter schools was not only to support and encourage educational innovation, but also to disseminate the results of research conducted in charter schools more broadly across the Alberta education system. Fifteen years after the first charter schools opened, we are asking Albertans to help us develop a vision for the future of charter schools. In particular, we are interested in finding out what interested members of the public think about a number of ideas that have been proposed for the future role and purpose of charter schools.","num_resources":0,"num_tags":0,"other":null,"owner_org":"education","placeofpub":"Edmonton","private":false,"relationships_as_object":[],"relationships_as_subject":[],"replacedby_title":"","replacedby_uri":null,"replaces_title":"","replaces_uri":null,"resources":[],"revision_id":null,"sensitivity":"unrestricted","seriestitle":"","seriestitle2":null,"seriestitle3":null,"spatialcoverage":"","state":null,"subject":"Charter schools--Alberta--Surveys","subject2":"Educational innovations--Alberta","subject3":"","tags":[],"time_coverage_from":null,"time_coverage_to":null,"title":"Action on research and innovation: the future of charter schools in Alberta","topic":["Education-EarlyChildhoodtoGrade12"],"tracking_summary":{"recent":0,"total":0},"pubtype":"report","updatefrequency":"Once","url":null,"usageconsiderations":null,"version":null,"subject4":"","subject5":"","subject6":"","contributor6":null,"contributor5":null,"contributor4":null,"type":"publications"}

The RCP is aligned with Alberta�s research and innovation system and investments are made in the context of Government of Alberta (GoA) research and innovation priorities and Institutional Research Plan (IRP) priorities. The RCP uses a cost-shared funding approach to provide up to 40% of the total eligible project costs for successful proposals, enabling projects to leverage support from the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI) and other sources.

The activities they choose for enjoyment, where they live and take vacations, what they teach their children, and who they select as their heroes all demonstrate how important the sector is to the lives of Albertans. The Government of Alberta has long recognized the importance of the sector, and has been deeply involved through the development of policies, the passage of legislation, the design of programs, through working with partners, and through the provision of funding. Research clearly points to the importance of active lifestyles to the physical, social and emotional health and well-being of Albertans and their communities. The Government of Alberta recognizes this research and has drawn on this evidence to reflect its direction related to recreation, active living and sport. The following pages outline a ten year policy to refocus government initiatives, challenge partners, and encourage Albertans to become more active. This new policy, Active Alberta, sets out a vision for recreation, active living and sport: Albertans enjoy a high quality of life, improved health and wellness, strong communities, economic benefits and personal fulfillment, through recreation, active living and sport.","num_resources":0,"num_tags":0,"other":null,"owner_org":"governmentofalberta","placeofpub":"Edmonton","private":false,"relationships_as_object":[],"relationships_as_subject":[],"replacedby_title":"","replacedby_uri":null,"replaces_title":"","replaces_uri":null,"resources":[],"revision_id":null,"sensitivity":"unrestricted","seriestitle":"","seriestitle2":null,"seriestitle3":null,"spatialcoverage":"","state":null,"subject":"Health--Government policy--Alberta","subject2":"Recreation--Government policy--Alberta","subject3":"Outdoor life--Government policy--Alberta","tags":[],"time_coverage_from":"2011-01-01","time_coverage_to":"2021-01-01","title":"Active Alberta: 2011-2021","topic":["Government","SportsandRecreation"],"tracking_summary":{"recent":0,"total":0},"pubtype":"policy","updatefrequency":"Once","url":null,"usageconsiderations":null,"version":null,"subject4":"Exercise--Alberta","subject5":"","subject6":"","contributor6":null,"contributor5":null,"contributor4":null,"type":"publications"}

Those invited represented a wide spectrum of cultural interests from Alberta's arts, heritage and museums, multicultural, nonprofit/voluntary, recreation, creative industries, corporate communities and youth representatives. The goal of the forum was to find innovative solutions to common challenges while capitalizing on opportunities to build a sustainable culture sector. The result was a series of strategies to address challenges frequently faced by individuals and organizations striving to make Alberta�s culture sector healthy and sustainable. The forum built on regional dialogues held with both the nonprofit/voluntary sector and arts sector in communities across Alberta in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Input from the regional dialogues increased understanding and provided valuable guidance to government.

In order to sustain Alberta�s growing economy, the LUF must achieve pre-defined environmental and social goals. The content in this report was prepared by Sierra Systems in conjunction with Banister Research and Consulting Inc. In May 2008, Banister Research & Consulting Inc. was contracted by Sierra Systems to conduct online and hard-copy self-complete surveys regarding the Government of Alberta�s LUF. The analysis of these findings is presented in Section 2 of this report. In addition to the survey responses Albertans provided other written submissions of varying length and content. Sierra Systems conducted an analysis of more than 100 individual written submissions from individuals and organizations, which were received by the Government of Alberta (and Sierra Systems) as part of the public stream of consultation for the LUF document released in May 2008. Responses were received from private citizens as well as from various organizations and associations, which include: municipal associations, cities, towns, counties and municipal districts, the energy industry, environmental groups, members of the legislative assembly, landowners groups, community-planning services, chambers of commerce, wilderness associations and aboriginal communities.

The Plan was developed by the Alberta Secretariat for Action on Homelessness and provides policy direction to end current homelessness and prevent future homelessness from a provincial perspective. Seven communities (Calgary, Edmonton, Wood Buffalo, Grande Prairie, Lethbridge, Red Deer and Medicine Hat) have multi-year plans to end homelessness that align with the provincial plan and address local priorities. Alberta�s Plan, including the community-based approach, has received provincial and national awards and has gained international interest. In the first three years of implementation, Human Services has worked with its community partners to provide permanent housing to over 5,900 homeless Albertans along with needed wraparound supports, with more than 80 per cent maintaining their housing. Housing 5,900 formerly homeless Albertans and providing them with supports to help them maintain their housing is a significant accomplishment. In order to end homelessness in Alberta by 2019, the Province must maintain the momentum generated by the successes seen in the first three years of implementation of the 10-Year Plan to End Homelessness. Alberta�s communities have the basic systems in place to house individuals and end their homelessness. But this is not enough to end homelessness in Alberta by 2019. Homelessness is a complex problem with a variety of causes and manifestations. It requires comprehensive solutions that cut across multiple service systems and better integration with on-the-ground community organizations. Strong leadership and effective collaboration, with an emphasis on strategic planning and performance management, are essential to continued success.","num_resources":0,"num_tags":0,"other":null,"owner_org":"humanservices","placeofpub":"Edmonton","private":false,"relationships_as_object":[],"relationships_as_subject":[],"replacedby_title":"","replacedby_uri":null,"replaces_title":"","replaces_uri":null,"resources":[],"revision_id":null,"sensitivity":"unrestricted","seriestitle":"","seriestitle2":null,"seriestitle3":null,"spatialcoverage":"","state":null,"subject":"Homelessness--Alberta","subject2":"Homeless persons--Alberta","subject3":"","tags":[],"time_coverage_from":null,"time_coverage_to":null,"title":"What we heard . . .

This is a trend largely related to the strong performance of Alberta�s economy. Until 2006, less than one per cent of the province�s total labour force was TFWs. However, with the federal changes to the Temporary Foreign Worker (TFW) Program in 2007 and Alberta�s growing economy at the time, the province saw a significant spike in the number of TFWs in the province to a high of almost 58,000 in 2008. In 2010, Teresa Woo-Paw, Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Employment and Immigration, was mandated to carry out a series of public consultations to identify where the TFW Program fits in Alberta�s labour force planning, what role TFWs fill in Alberta�s labour market and how to ensure the program is best serving the needs of Albertans. Over an eleven-week period, 14 consultation sessions were held in 12 different communities across Alberta. Stakeholders in attendance included immigrant-serving organizations, municipal governments, labour organizations, lawyers, consultants, educators and other community stakeholders. Nine closed sessions were held with TFWs. In her report, Ms. Woo- aw concludes that Alberta cannot continue to use the TFW Program to fill our province�s long-term labour shortages. Of particular issue was the growing concern that increasing numbers of TFWs were filling what are essentially permanent jobs in Alberta�s labour force.

Never have so many people been evacuated, or so much property been lost. Never has there been a rebuilding job like the one faced in the aftermath of the wildfires � roughly a quarter of the Town of Slave Lake was destroyed along with a large number of structures in the adjoining Municipal District of Lesser Slave River No.124. Governments, citizens, first responders and groups across the province came together in a heroic and unprecedented way to help fight the wildfires, support residents and help the affected communities to rebuild and recover. When an event unlike any seen before occurs, there are always lessons to be learned. The Government of Alberta, through Alberta Municipal Affairs, commissioned this study to examine what happened and what insights can be gained from the experience of the wildfires and their aftermath. This review is not about blame and liability. It is about taking this rare opportunity to learn from the ways that this incredible event inspired Albertans to collaborate, even as it stretched our ability to respond. It is about ensuring that this experience leaves the province stronger and better prepared for future disasters.","num_resources":0,"num_tags":0,"other":null,"owner_org":"municipalaffairs","placeofpub":"Edmonton","private":false,"relationships_as_object":[],"relationships_as_subject":[],"replacedby_title":"","replacedby_uri":null,"replaces_title":"","replaces_uri":null,"resources":[],"revision_id":null,"sensitivity":"unrestricted","seriestitle":"","seriestitle2":null,"seriestitle3":null,"spatialcoverage":"Slave Lake","state":null,"subject":"Emergency management--Alberta","subject2":"Disaster relief--Alberta","subject3":"Wildfires--Alberta--Lesser Slave Lake","tags":[],"time_coverage_from":null,"time_coverage_to":null,"title":"Lesser Slave Lake regional urban interface wildfire - lessons learned: final report","topic":["SafetyandEmergencyServices"],"tracking_summary":{"recent":0,"total":0},"pubtype":"report","updatefrequency":"Once","url":null,"usageconsiderations":null,"version":null,"subject4":"","subject5":"","subject6":"","contributor6":null,"contributor5":null,"contributor4":null,"type":"publications"}

The Alberta Land Stewardship Act supports the LUF and establishes the legal basis for the development of regional plans.

The system is founded on setting managing to clear policies and cumulative outcomes, providing assurance and maintaining a monitoring and measurement system to measure teh achievement of outcomes.

While our rural economy is strong, there is always room for improvement. As the province prepares to welcome another million new Albertans in the next decade, maintaining a thriving rural economy is vital. The Government of Alberta, seeking ways to ensure our rural economy continues to flourish, created a Rural Economic Development Task Force in early 2014, chaired by the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development and supported by a team of rural MLAs. The task force held eight in-person roundtable discussions in Athabasca, Fairview, Edson, Olds, Medicine Hat, Lethbridge, Vermilion and Camrose. The engagement sessions were attended by more than 230 participants, representing a variety of stakeholders such as municipalities, post-secondary institutions, chambers of commerce, regional development entities and industry associations.
